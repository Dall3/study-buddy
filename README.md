Study-buddy project for PA1414

Project description:
Education is an integral part of our lives. We all encounter the necessity to engage in deliberate practice
when acquiring new knowledge, be it through pursuing a university curriculum, mastering a skill, or
leaning a different language. While an array of applications exists to aid learners in improving their
abilities and preparing for assessments, these tools often remain confined to particular domain, lacking
the flexibility to enable learners to apply the content from their courses or study materials in their
practice sessions. Hence, a prevailing need emerges for a universal solution that empowers learners to
effectively refine their understanding and expertise across various subjects and skills, using their own
course materials as the foundation for their practice
